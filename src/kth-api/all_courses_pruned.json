In addition to enforcing concepts and techniques, the laboratory work and seminar will also prepare students to design, undertake, and critically evaluate GIS projects, and the seminars will strengthen the students' public speaking skills as they present scientific articles to their peers and will improve the students' scientific comprehension, design, presentation, and writing skills as they read, summarize, and review the seminar articles.</p>",

Once the easily accessible resources of U-235 become exhausted, a transition to reactors capable of breeding their own fissile fuel from U-238 may become economically feasible. Breeder reactors of \"Generation IV\"-design, would besides plutonium, also recycle minor actinides, in order to reduce the long-term radio-toxic inventory sent to geological repositories. Another Generation IV-objective is the operation at high temperature, leading to better conversion efficiency, thus compensating for the higher maintenance and fuel costs of these systems. After this course, you will be able to make design choices that makes Generation IV reactors sustainable, safe and reasonably economical. This objective is achieved if you show that you are able to</p><ul><li>Calculate and analyse reactor safety parameters in fast neutron reactors.</li><li>Assess breeding performance for potential fuels and coolants</li><li>Select structural materials that permit high burnup in fast neutron spectra.</li></ul><p>An intrinsic objective of the course is to achieve skills necessary for working as a scientist or engineer. The main assignment is therefore formulated as a project/research task, which will be presented in the form of a conference paper.The objective is accomplished if you show that you are able to</p><ul><li>identify missing pieces of information necessary to complete the research task and independently find this information from external sources.</li><li>assess and use contents of references,</li><li>communicate with your colleagues and your teacher about progress and problems arising during research,</li><li>orally as well as in writing present the outcome of your results in a scientific and pedagogic manner.</li></ul><p>Passing the course typically means that you have attended 20 hours of meetings, and performed 140 hours of work in your office.

Moreover, a systematic study on requirements, challenges and development of information technologies for industry digitalization has not been developed yet. This course aims to address these problems by developing systematic and vertical-application oriented course for industry digitalization. The main objectives of the course are to train the students on the key information technologies for industry digital transformation and to inspire the students for potential new research topics. After the course, the students should:&#160;</p><ol><li>Know an overview of and the technical requirements for industry digitalization.</li><li>Know the information technologies for sustainable industries.&#160;</li><li>Understand key requirements and enabling technologies of information technologies (both theories and practices) for industry digitalization, including e.g., wireless networks, AI, security, digital twin and global coverage etc.</li><li>Understand how the information technologies are applied in vertical use cases for industry digitalization.</li><li>Understand recent development and existing challenges of information technologies for industry digitalization.&#160;</li></ol>",

In the era of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) in which physical devices such as sensors and RFID tags are integrated with electronics to provide capabilities of sensing, computing and communication, assuring security of such systems becomes a great challenge. In order to tackle this problem, industry is making efforts across multiple layers involving cryptographic algorithms, protocols, secure integrated circuits, hardware architecture, etc. From the academic side, we have the responsibility to educate and prepare our students - the future engineers, for the security challenges of the IoT era. Specifically, in this course, we aim to make the students aware of potential hardware vulnerabilities and to give them the necessary knowledge and skills required for building trustworthy hardware.</p><p>Upon completion, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Describe state-of-the-art hardware security techniques. Justify their targeted applications and limitations. Describe how security is assured in an exemplary application.</li><li>Describe the threats to a system from the hardware perspective as well as available countermeasures. Apply the knowledge to select a suitable set of countermeasures for a specific threat scenario.</li><li>Analyze and critically assess trade-offs between system performance, cost, and security. Exemplify some of the trade-offs that are available to designers of electronic and embedded systems.</li><li>Explain the need for hardware security primitives. Justify pros and cons of different primitives and select a suitable one for a specific application.</li><li>Apply the knowledge to design a small electronic or embedded system with enhanced security in a group project.

Real transport problems are analyzed with free or commercial software implementations of these models and solvers.</p><p>After successful completion of the course, students should be able to</p><ul><li>apply the basic principles of simulation;</li><li>interpret and analyze stochastic simulation results;</li><li>select application-specific models and simulation methods;</li><li>collect and use real data to calibrate and validate transport simulators;</li><li>deploy simulations for scenario analysis, prediction, and optimization;</li><li>account for and discuss strengths and weaknesses of different simulation methods.</li></ul>",

Be aware about that soil and water are not merely physical resources that can be exploited for human benefit using appropriate technologies, but there is need to conceptualize them as &#8217;social&#8217; resources that need to be &#8217;governed&#8217; &amp; &#8217;managed&#8217; sustainably in a fast changing world; - Identify main issues/factors, roles, and actors underlying the processes of land and water governance and understand the various operational challenges in different societal settings; - Understand the complexity of land and water governance processes through analysing its connection with political, socio-economic, environmental and ecological aspects and also recognising cross cutting issues such as poverty, gender, social inequality, culture and climate change; - Learn from concrete case studies &amp; reflect upon sustainable approaches for land &amp; water governance processes and goals. - Examine the land and water linkages and demonstrate through practical examples and project work opportunities and challenges in integrated land and water planning approach for creative and efficient uses of resources in relation to socio-economic and environmental aspects;</p>",
