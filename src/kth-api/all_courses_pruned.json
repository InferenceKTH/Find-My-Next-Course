In addition to enforcing concepts and techniques, the laboratory work and seminar will also prepare students to design, undertake, and critically evaluate GIS projects, and the seminars will strengthen the students' public speaking skills as they present scientific articles to their peers and will improve the students' scientific comprehension, design, presentation, and writing skills as they read, summarize, and review the seminar articles.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The production of commercial nuclear power today is dependent on the availability of U-235, the only fissile nuclide naturally present on earth. Once the easily accessible resources of U-235 become exhausted, a transition to reactors capable of breeding their own fissile fuel from U-238 may become economically feasible. Breeder reactors of \"Generation IV\"-design, would besides plutonium, also recycle minor actinides, in order to reduce the long-term radio-toxic inventory sent to geological repositories. Another Generation IV-objective is the operation at high temperature, leading to better conversion efficiency, thus compensating for the higher maintenance and fuel costs of these systems. After this course, you will be able to make design choices that makes Generation IV reactors sustainable, safe and reasonably economical. This objective is achieved if you show that you are able to</p><ul><li>Calculate and analyse reactor safety parameters in fast neutron reactors.</li><li>Assess breeding performance for potential fuels and coolants</li><li>Select structural materials that permit high burnup in fast neutron spectra.</li></ul><p>An intrinsic objective of the course is to achieve skills necessary for working as a scientist or engineer. The main assignment is therefore formulated as a project/research task, which will be presented in the form of a conference paper.The objective is accomplished if you show that you are able to</p><ul><li>identify missing pieces of information necessary to complete the research task and independently find this information from external sources.</li><li>assess and use contents of references,</li><li>communicate with your colleagues and your teacher about progress and problems arising during research,</li><li>orally as well as in writing present the outcome of your results in a scientific and pedagogic manner.</li></ul><p>Passing the course typically means that you have attended 20 hours of meetings, and performed 140 hours of work in your office. Most effort is thus to be done out of class.</p>",

In the era of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) in which physical devices such as sensors and RFID tags are integrated with electronics to provide capabilities of sensing, computing and communication, assuring security of such systems becomes a great challenge. In order to tackle this problem, industry is making efforts across multiple layers involving cryptographic algorithms, protocols, secure integrated circuits, hardware architecture, etc. From the academic side, we have the responsibility to educate and prepare our students - the future engineers, for the security challenges of the IoT era. Specifically, in this course, we aim to make the students aware of potential hardware vulnerabilities and to give them the necessary knowledge and skills required for building trustworthy hardware.</p><p>Upon completion, students will be able to:</p><ul><li>Describe state-of-the-art hardware security techniques. Justify their targeted applications and limitations. Describe how security is assured in an exemplary application.</li><li>Describe the threats to a system from the hardware perspective as well as available countermeasures. Apply the knowledge to select a suitable set of countermeasures for a specific threat scenario.</li><li>Analyze and critically assess trade-offs between system performance, cost, and security. Exemplify some of the trade-offs that are available to designers of electronic and embedded systems.</li><li>Explain the need for hardware security primitives. Justify pros and cons of different primitives and select a suitable one for a specific application.</li><li>Apply the knowledge to design a small electronic or embedded system with enhanced security in a group project.

The main objective of the thesis work is to provide an opportunity for the student to conduct an independent research and/or design proposal related to a specific interest in the field of Urban Planning and Design. The student shall learn to formulate research and/or design problem, define researchable questions and develop solutions for the defined problems.</p><p>While working on their thesis projects students will implement their knowledge on an advanced level and demonstrate an in depth capacity to address challenges stemming from the complex ways in which cities function, grow and develop. The students will gain the professional and theoretical tools to conduct an in depth research as well as to implement their skills and knowledge through the process of design.&#160;&#160;</p>",
